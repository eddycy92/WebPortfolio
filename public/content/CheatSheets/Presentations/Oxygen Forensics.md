- Two examples of a complex / challenging deal.  Include a deal you won and one deal that you lost.
	- Complex Deal Won:
		- **Industry:** Automotive 
		- **Use case:** e-discovery, corporate investigations, compliance.
		- Approach: 
			- Cant say the name of the company for privacy reasons but i can say it was one of the latest's big car industry mergers in the US.
			- I contacted a lead that came from a webinar
			- Performed discovery, confirmed needs assessment and budget of the deal before providing any quotes.
			- We found our first difficulty when we found out that the compliance for said company had been frozen because of another department had let a deal fall through.
			- In our records I found that one of their departments that worked with the government side was already our customer so I sent the deal to the next step which was finalizing the decision on which tools or voucher pack to buy including if any training was going to be included.
			- There was urgency on the deal because it was the end of the fiscal cycle and their department needed to spend some money before the closing for taxing and budgeting purposes.
			-  The response from leadership was almost immediate due to the urgency and out determination to make our relationship with that logo stronger.
			- 3 to 4 hours later our inside sales teammate finished cleaning up details and  closed. 
			- the package included SaaS solutions and training with opportunity to expand the license or upgrade package as their department grew. More over, our Sales Engineer got introduced to the cyber and legal team to learn more about the solution and how they could implemented on their process.
		  
	- Complex deal lost:
		- **Industry:** Construction 
		- Use case: e-discovery, corporate investigations, compliance.
		- Approach:
			- on of Mexico's and central America largest company in the private sector
			- Unable to say the name, but i can say that they are the biggest produces of one material used in the construction industry.
			- Even thought, in Mexico, Israel expo control is sanctioned for the Government. Mexico private sector is still allowed to to purchase the solution, only if the deal is submitted to Defense Export Control Agency (DECA).
			- the Request for information (RFI), request for quotation (RFQ), compliance and demo where already completed and submitted to DECA. The permission to sell was denied.
			- The size of the deal was in the value around half a million with potential to purchase additional things to their package, with multiple licenses and service bluchers across countries. 
			- We had to give the customer the bad news and explain why we were not able to approver the sale.
			- We had explained, very transparently at the beginning about the whole process.
			- Me and my Technical Account executive were expecting this deal to work out because it was all in the clear. That is how I and my Technical account Executive had to dial down the Latin America deals, specially where Governments were banned. because of the likelihood to lost the deal and DECA not approving the sale regardless of being complaint and having all the requirements.
