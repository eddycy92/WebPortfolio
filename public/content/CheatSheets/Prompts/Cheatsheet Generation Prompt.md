## Purpose 
Create a comprehensive and well-organized cheatsheet for essential commands. It being Linux, Docker commands, networking troubleshooting, system monitoring, disk management, file management, user management, service management, WordPress commands, GPU monitoring, package management, PCI commands, module commands, device commands, mount commands, configuration commands, and live environment commands or more. Or from the conversation we just had, typically about coding. The cheatsheet should be structured in a way that is easy to read, categorize, and use in markdown applications. 

## Structure 
### General Format Each command should include: 
1. **Command Syntax**: The actual command to be executed. 
2. **Definition**: A clear and concise explanation of what the command does. 
3. **Tags**: Relevant categories to group commands by use-case and the library/tool they belong to. 
### Categorization
Commands should be primarily categorized by the library/tool they belong to and secondarily by their use case. This ensures that related commands are grouped together, making it easier to find and understand them. 
### Example Structure 
The following example illustrates the format and structure required for the cheatsheet:

```markdown
